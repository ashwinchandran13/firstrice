My **first** linux rice using i3-gaps WM

## Introduction

Happened to surf the great giver *reddit* where I found a post on a sub-reddit named [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)
which at the time I had no clue what it was about but with a very catchy screenshot of a system interface. From there I just started
surf stuff up from the post details about screenshots. Among them **Tiling Window Managers** was the term often defined with different sets of 
answers. You see when a normal noob linux user who has just installed Ubuntu or Mint in his pc sees only one desktop enviroment namely
GNOME, Cinnamon, KDE Plasma, Mate etc. So the term window manager is just a highly configurable desktop environment available as packages
just waiting to be get installed in your systems and to be played with as you like without even removing your default Desktop Environment.

I happend to find a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/j1I63wGcvU4) on i3wm which made my base on [*ricing*](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ricing) my Linux Mint
19.1 Tessa with Cinammon as desktop environment. However that tutorial didn't gave me my choice of outputs so happened to play with 
i3-gaps (which gave gaps between windows XD).

>This repo consist of my configs aka dotfiles which may help anyone just to simply copy paste this configs
